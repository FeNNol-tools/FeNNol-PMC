# FeNNix-Bio1 models


This folder contains the FeNNix-Bio1 foundation models from 

    T. Plé et al., A Foundation Model for Accurate Atomistic Simulations in Drug Design, ChemRxiv 2025; doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-f1hgn-v4


These models come in two sizes:
 - small --> `fennix-bio1S.fnx`
 - medium --> `fennix-bio1M.fnx`

The root directory contains the latest models. The `v*` directories contain specific releases with their respective training input files.
